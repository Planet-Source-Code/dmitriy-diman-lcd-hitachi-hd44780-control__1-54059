### Description

This is a module that allows you to control a Hitachi HD44780 (or compatible) chipset LCD display (20x4)

which is connected to the LTP (Printer ) port

With this module you can control 20x4 LCD Display, and with some minor modifications the module can be adapted to control 20x2, 16x4, 16x2 displays as well. I know there's similar code snippets out there, but i just finished my own lcd project and felt like this is the simpliest yet powerfull piece of code that i just had to share with ya. Enjoy.
